To finish our project in time we'll need to divide the development in small tasks:

- Create the layout for the main screen:
  * Create the divisions on the app (Top, middle (biggest one) and bottom);
  * Create and position buttons (New task and Timer button);
  * Create the streak icon;
  * Choose the placeholder for the created activities;
 
- Create a new activity for "Create new task" menu;
  * Create all the blanks for this menu (Task name, Due date, Alarm, Repeat and note)
  * Make sure every field receive the right type of data
  * When user click on the due date, it should open a roll-type selector for the day, month and year
  
- Create a new activity for "Pomodoro Timer" menu;
  * Create the timer and break field;
  * Create start/stop buttom and cancel buttom;
  
  
 These are mainly layout tasks and the chosen components need to be picked wisely to address coding properly. Let's talk about it in a time where everybody can be involved.
