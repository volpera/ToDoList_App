# ToDoList_App

ToDoListApp

This is a group project for COMP2160, the development of an application to solve a specific problem.

Our proposal is a To Do List App containing some features to increase user interactions and their productivity. 
The idea consists in a traditional approach followed by a streak counter that will count a sequence of days in which the user accomplished all their duties. 
Another unique feature is the Pomodoro Timer designed to help users who need more focus while dealing with their daily tasks.
